<!-- The three sections: "Problem to solve", "Intended users" and "Proposal", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our development team validate the problem and start working on a solution. -->

### Release notes

<!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature. -->

### Problem to solve 

<!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, "As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value)." -->

### Intended users

<!-- Who will use this feature? -->

### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? -->

### Further details

<!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. -->

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.-->
